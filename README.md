# FoodOrderingSystem
This Food Ordering System in Java uses linked lists to store orders and queues to process them in FIFO order. It includes customer and order details through two classes, Customer and Restaurant, showcasing object-oriented programming and basic data structures in a simple restaurant workflow.


üìù Project Description:
This Food Ordering System is a Java-based application that simulates the real-time food ordering process using fundamental data structures like Linked List and Queue. The system is designed to manage customer orders efficiently while maintaining the sequence of order processing.

Each order is represented by the Restaurant class, which stores essential order details such as:
-Order ID
-Time of Order
-Order Status
-Food Name and Price
-Payment Method

The Customer class associates each customer with an order and includes:
-Customer ID
-Name
-Phone Number
-Email

The system allows:
-Creating and storing multiple customer orders in a linked list, enabling dynamic memory management.
-Handling the first-in-first-out (FIFO) order processing using a queue, ensuring orders are completed in the order they were received.
-Updating order statuses and payment methods dynamically.

This modular design supports the simulation of a restaurant's order workflow and serves as a practical example of how Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) integrates with data structures to solve real-world problems.
